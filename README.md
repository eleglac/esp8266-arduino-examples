# esp8266-arduino-examples
A collection of Arduino sketches based around the ESP8266 ESP-01 platform.  Other parts that show up in this code include the MCP3008 10-bit ADC, the DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, the BMP280 atmospheric pressure sensor, and the WS2812B programmable RGB LEDs.

This code is in a highly unrefined and experimental state, and in particular there is little differentiation between example code found on various forums and my own contributions.  My next steps for this project are thus to make that differentiation, remove redundant code, and include schematics of the various circuits I used for each of these examples.
